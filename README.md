## GreyRock

### Purpose:
A simple mobile app that helps people contain and reduce their social media exposure. \
Works with:
- Instagram
- TikTok
- Facebook
- Snapchat

### What Does It Do?
Users can select which apps they would like to manage, and set a time limit for engagement. \
:alarm_clock: Once the time is up a transparent grey layer appears over the full screen, allowing content to still come through, but in a reduced capacity.

GreyRock is a reminder that your time is the most valuable thing you own.
